- **Always commit changes**: After making any changes to the code, always commit them to git with an appropriate commit message that describes what was changed and why.
- **NEVER mention Claude in commit messages**: Commit messages must never contain any reference to Claude, AI assistance, or automated generation. Keep all commit messages professional and focused on the technical changes made.
