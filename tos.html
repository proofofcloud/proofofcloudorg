                <p class="policy-meta"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> October 22, 2025</p>

                <p>These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of the Proof of Cloud website located at <code>proofofcloud.org</code>, related subdomains, APIs, documentation, sandbox environments, and any associated content or services (collectively, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo;). By accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must refrain from using the Services.</p>

                <h2>1. About Proof of Cloud</h2>
                <p>Proof of Cloud is a vendor-neutral alliance committed to maintaining a verifiable registry of modern Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) hardware identities and associated attestations. The Services provide informational resources, developer tooling, and demonstration experiences to support confidential computing workloads.</p>

                <h2>2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
                <p>You may use the Services only if you are at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding agreement. Certain features may require registering an account or requesting sandbox access. You agree to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to keep that information up-to-date.</p>

                <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
                <p>You agree not to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Use the Services in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations.</li>
                    <li>Attempt to access non-public features, disrupt service availability, or compromise system integrity.</li>
                    <li>Submit malicious, fraudulent, or unauthorized attestations or identity artifacts.</li>
                    <li>Misrepresent your affiliation with Proof of Cloud or any alliance member.</li>
                    <li>Use automated tooling that imposes unreasonable load on our infrastructure.</li>

                <h2>4. Attestation Submissions and Registry Data</h2>
                <p>The Services may allow you to submit TEE attestations or related metadata for verification. You represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to provide such data, and that the data is accurate to the best of your knowledge. Proof of Cloud may use submitted data to evaluate attestation validity, enrich the registry, or improve verification tooling. We may decline or remove any submission at our sole discretion.</p>

                <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
                <p>Except for content you submit, all materials on the Services—including text, visuals, software, and branding—are owned by Proof of Cloud and its licensors, and are protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
