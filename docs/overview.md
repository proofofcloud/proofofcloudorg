# Proof of Cloud

We are proposing **Proof-of-Cloud**: an alliance aimed at providing independent endorsement that hardware is securely hosted in verified physical locations.

**Key goals:**

1. Maintain a registry identifying securely hosted TEE hardware
2. Establish governance through a DAO-like organization
3. Continuously refine and maintain methodologies for evidence verification
